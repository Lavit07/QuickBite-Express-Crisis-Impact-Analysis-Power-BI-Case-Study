## QuickBite Express Crisis Impact Analysis: Power BI Case Study
### 📊 Executive Summary
This project analyzes the operational and financial impact of a major business crisis on QuickBite Express, a food delivery startup.
The analysis engineered an interactive Power BI dashboard to diagnose the crisis, utilizing a custom waterfall analysis to pinpoint a 70% revenue decline. This revenue crash was driven primarily by **a 68.93% collapse in order volume (dropping from 146K to 35K orders)** and **a staggering 96.92% spike in cancellations**. The dashboard provides actionable insights into customer churn, sentiment drop, and restaurant partner impact to guide the company's turnaround strategy.

### 💼 Business Problem
QuickBite Express is a Bengaluru-based food-tech startup founded in 2020. In June 2025, the company faced a severe crisis triggered by a viral social media incident regarding food safety violations, compounded by a week-long delivery outage during the monsoon season.
Stakeholders needed comprehensive insights to execute a recovery budget effectively, specifically looking to understand:
1.	The true scale of revenue leakage and order volume collapse across different phases (pre-crisis vs. crisis).
2.	The specific segments of loyal customers that were lost and the associated financial impact.
3.	The impact on partner restaurants and shifts in customer sentiment/ratings.

### 🛠️ Solution Overview
I engineered an interactive Power BI Dashboard designed to diagnose the business crisis and track recovery metrics.
Key Features:
•	**Custom Waterfall Analysis:** Visualizes the step-by-step revenue leakage from Pre-Crisis to Crisis Sales, isolating the exact financial damage of volume loss vs. cancellation spikes.
•	**Customer Behavior Segmentation:** Dynamically isolates and tracks churned high-value users based on historic order frequency and ratings.
•	**Dynamic Slicing & Metric Selection:** Allows leadership to toggle between Orders, Cancellations, Rating, and Late Delivery Time, sliced dynamically by Cuisine and Phase (Crisis vs. Pre-Crisis).

### 🔎 Key Insights & Findings
**1. Revenue & Volume Collapse**
•	Insight: Total revenue fell by 70% during the crisis period.
•	Root Cause: The revenue drop was not due to lower spending per user, but rather a massive 68.93% drop in overall order volume (146K down to 35K) and a 96.92% increase in cancellations.
•	Silver Lining: The Average Order Value (AOV) remained remarkably stable (₹351.89 pre-crisis vs. ₹351.30 crisis), proving that the core customer base maintains high loyalty and spending habits despite the operational failures.
**2. High-Value Customer Churn**
•	Insight: The crisis alienated 2,828 "Loyal High Value Customers" (defined as users with 3+ earlier orders and a >4.0 rating).
•	Impact: The churn of these specific high-value users resulted in a quantified loss of 941.49K in revenue.
•	Sentiment Shift: Customer sentiment dropped drastically from a positive ~0.8 in pre-crisis months (Jan-March) to a negative -0.3 by August and September.
**3. Partner Restaurant Impact**
•	Insight: Top-performing restaurant partners suffered devastating order declines.
•	Data: Establishments like "Royal Curry Mahal" and "Taste of Cafe Corner" saw order declines of -94.00% and -92.00% respectively.

### 📈 Recommendations
Based on the data, the following strategic actions are recommended:
1.	**Targeted Win-Back Campaigns:** Deploy specialized incentives, personalized apologies, and heavy discounts exclusively targeting the 2,828 lost high-value customers, as their stable AOV indicates they are highly profitable once retained.
2.	**Restaurant Retention Initiatives:** Immediately engage with the hardest-hit top restaurants (like Royal Curry Mahal) with zero-commission periods or featured placements to prevent them from migrating to competitors.
3.	**SLA & Infrastructure Overhaul:** Since cancellations spiked by 96.92% (largely tied to the monsoon delivery outage), logistics routing must be optimized for severe weather to prevent future operational bottlenecks.
